First step: add capabilities to the haas binary

The capabilities are added per file. This is why we need to modify the httpd binary itself. The capability we need to add is CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE, which is explicitly defined as the capacity for an executable to bind to a port less than 1024.

You need to be root to do that, so first, be root. Then, add the capability to the httpd binary:

root@myhost # setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep /path_to_file/haas

Check that the capability is added:

root@myhost # getcap /path_to_file/haas
/path_to_file/haas = cap_net_bind_service+ep
